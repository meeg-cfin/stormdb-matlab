# stormdb-matlab
Matlab functions for interacting with the STORM database at CFIN.

This utility allows you to retrieve the full path to your raw files from the STORM database within Matlab. This usually serves as input to a file conversion routine for preprocessing of MEG, EEG, ERG, EMG, ExG, MRI or behavioural data. If your project requires a particular functionality that is not supported, please create an issue above so that we can further develop the routine.
